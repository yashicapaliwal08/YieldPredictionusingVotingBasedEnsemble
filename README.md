   ```
5. Features
   Data Visualization: Generates various plots to visualize the distribution and trends in the dataset.
   Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the dataset for model training.
   Model Training and Evaluation: Trains multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, Decision Trees, Extra Trees, Linear Regression, and Extreme Gradient Boosting) and     evaluates their performance using cross-validation.
   Yield Prediction: Predicts crop yields based on the trained models.
